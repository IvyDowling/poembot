# poembot
This is a modern web implementation of my PoemBot from 2020 on my blue-ivy.github.io website. Re-worked some of this with a buddy and I wanted to open it up for the wholewideweb ;3

If you're taking on this project yourself, go ahead and add your plain text into the display:none div in the index.html file. That section is read by the markov chain poem writer. Adding to the corpus appends whatever is in the paragraph\<p> to that invisible body of text.

==Future== <br>
- I'd like to make it possible for this to save itself off as another html page with the trained corpus
- I want to pull in new words by using the WordNet
- Advanced formatting options would be great too, pulling in fixed CSS rules or something for artsy stuff
